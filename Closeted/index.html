    <p>You were born in a small town called Cyniza. Unlike those big cities near the sea, Cyniza is located in an landlocked area with poor accessibility. People don't have many chances to see what's outside. They just keep their simple and conservative lifestyle. They're too stubborn to make any changes.</p>
<br />
<p>You could have married a woman, raised a couple of babies and lived an orthodox life like the rest of them. But you can't! Because you're GAY. The people in this town believe it's wrong for a boy to love another boy. They like to gossip about the unusual relationship between the same sex. </p>
<br />
<p>And your family is also very sensitive about this issue. Your father often tells you that your uncle ran out of the town because of his "inappropriate" sexual behaviors with a boy. He disppeared since then and became a family shame. Your father warns you not to be someone like your uncle.</p>

    <p>You parents believe good education can help you get on the right track. So, they sent you to a prestigious boarding school. This school is as strict as how people in this town stick to their lifestyle. They don't allow students to get out of the campus except for the weekends. They even give students classes at night.</p>
<br />
<p>But in this boarding school, you fall in love. The boy is called Zach. At the first sight, you know he's the one. Although you feel so right for each other, you both think it is not a good idea to come out of the closet in this place. You try to date as covertly as you can.</p>
<br />
<p>It is not easy to have some secret dates. You and Zach live in different dorms. You can only meet each other on campus. But too many unfriendly people around. They're curious about your relationship with Zach.</p>
